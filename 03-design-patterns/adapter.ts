/**
 * ADAPTER PATTERN
 * 
 * Definition:
 * The Adapter pattern allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together.
 * It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by wrapping an existing
 * class with a new interface.
 * 
 * When to Use:
 * - Integrate third-party libraries with incompatible interfaces
 * - Work with legacy code that can't be modified
 * - Make classes with different interfaces collaborate
 * - Reuse existing classes that don't match required interface
 * 
 * Benefits:
 * ‚úÖ Enables collaboration between incompatible classes
 * ‚úÖ Separates interface conversion logic from business logic
 * ‚úÖ Open/Closed Principle compliance
 * ‚úÖ Single Responsibility Principle
 * 
 * Drawbacks:
 * ‚ùå Increases code complexity with new interfaces and classes
 * ‚ùå Sometimes it's simpler to change the service class directly
 * 
 * Key Components:
 * 1. Target Interface - defines the domain-specific interface used by Client
 * 2. Adaptee - existing class with incompatible interface
 * 3. Adapter - implements Target interface and wraps Adaptee
 * 4. Client - uses objects through Target interface
 * 
 * Real-world Examples:
 * - Power adapters for different electrical standards
 * - Database drivers (MySQL, PostgreSQL adapters for common interface)
 * - Payment gateways (adapting different APIs to common interface)
 * - Media players (supporting different file formats)
 * - API wrappers (REST to GraphQL adapters)
