/**
 * STRATEGY PATTERN
 * 
 * Definition:
 * The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one,
 * and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently
 * from clients that use it.
 * 
 * When to Use:
 * - Multiple ways to perform a task (payment methods, sorting algorithms)
 * - Avoid conditional statements for algorithm selection
 * - Switch algorithms at runtime
 * - Open/Closed Principle - easy to add new strategies
 * 
 * Benefits:
 * ‚úÖ Eliminates conditional statements
 * ‚úÖ Easy to add new algorithms without changing existing code
 * ‚úÖ Algorithms can be tested independently
 * ‚úÖ Runtime algorithm switching
 * ‚úÖ Follows Open/Closed Principle
 * 
 * Drawbacks:
 * ‚ùå Clients must be aware of different strategies
 * ‚ùå Increased number of classes
 * ‚ùå Communication overhead between Strategy and Context
 * 
 * Key Components:
 * 1. Strategy Interface - defines common interface for all algorithms
 * 2. Concrete Strategies - implement different algorithms
 * 3. Context - uses a Strategy to execute the algorithm
 * 
 * Real-world Examples:
 * - Payment processing (Credit Card, PayPal, Crypto, Bank Transfer)
 * - Compression algorithms (ZIP, RAR, 7Z)
 * - Sorting algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort, BubbleSort)
 * - Navigation routes (Fastest, Shortest, Scenic)
 * - Discount calculations (Percentage, Fixed Amount, Buy-One-Get-One)
